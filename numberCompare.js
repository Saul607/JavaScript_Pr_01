//Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers.
//You can choose if those numbers will be equal ==, less than <, greater than >,
//less than or equal to <=, or greater than or equal to >= each other.
//Include an if, else if, and else statement.
// Create an alert() that gives feedback based on the number.
// Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.


//var num1 = 3; var num2 = 8;
//var num1 = 4; var num2 = 4;
var num1 = 20; var num2 = 8;
